# Git Push and Remote Pull Script 🚀

This script automates the process of pushing your changes to a Git repository and then updating a remote server via SSH. It handles the following steps in sequence:

1. Pushes your current branch (or a specified branch) to the remote Git repository
2. SSHs into your remote server
3. Performs a `git fetch` and `git reset --hard` to update the remote repository

> **Note:** This script is designed for quick updates of existing repositories. It requires that Git remotes are already properly set up in both your local and remote directories. It does not clone repositories or perform initial setup.

## Prerequisites

- Git installed and configured on both local and remote machines
- Existing Git repository with properly configured remotes on both local and remote directories
- SSH access to the remote server
- Proper permissions to push to the Git remote and update the remote directory

## Setup

### 1. Configure your .env file

Create a `.env` file in the same directory as the script with the following content:

```
# SSH credentials
SSH_USER=your_username
SSH_HOST=your.server.com
# The full path to the git repository on the remote server
REMOTE_PATH=/path/to/git/repository
```

You can copy and edit the included `.env.example` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Then edit the .env file with your preferred text editor
```

### Important Security Note

Make sure to add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore` to prevent accidentally committing sensitive credentials to your repository.

### 2. Make the script executable

```bash
chmod +x gitpushremotepull.sh
```

## Making it Available Globally on macOS

To use this script as a command from anywhere on your Mac:

### 1. Create a bin directory in your home folder (if it doesn't exist)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/bin
```

### 2. Create a symbolic link to your script

```bash
ln -s "/full/path/to/gitpushremotepull.sh" ~/bin/gitpushremotepull
```

Replace `/full/path/to/gitpushremotepull.sh` with the absolute path to your script. If you're in the script's directory, you can use:

```bash
ln -s "$(pwd)/gitpushremotepull.sh" ~/bin/gitpushremotepull
```

### 3. Add ~/bin to your PATH (if not already there)

For Zsh (default shell on newer macOS):

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

For Bash (older macOS versions):

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

## Usage

### Using the local script:

```bash
./gitpushremotepull.sh [branch_name]
```

### Using the global command (after setting up the symbolic link):

```bash
gitpushremotepull [branch_name]
```

If you don't specify a branch name, the script will use your current branch.
